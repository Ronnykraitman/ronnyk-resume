My name is Ronny Kraitman, im 33 years old from Tel-aviv, Israel

I'm a backend team lead in Dynamic yield.
I love Backend and quite despise Frontend
I focus on moving my team to a LLM-based world with Ai solutions
While developing top of the art technologies to answer our clients' most complex and sometimes
unknown desires

Some hobbies:
I love going to the beach, hanging out with my friends and drinking wine (responsibly)

Milestones:
1. Leading and developing the team's ML solution, from the drawing board to a high scale production solution
2. Leading and mentoring our team's AI and LLM solutions
3. Design and develop our own LLM features, making it from a developer game to actual profitable feature
